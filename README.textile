A tool to embed clojure in HTML

## Usage

Create a template file with the extension clj, with HTML inside it.

Eg: Consider a hammer template file, "template.clj" with the following contents

<div id="test">
Clojure code starts here. <br />
1 + 1 = 
%% (+ 1 1) %%
</div>


As you can see, the clojure code is inside the block demarkated by the symbol %%.

In order to eval the template, you will have to execute the following function

(convert-hammer-template-to-html "template.clj")

This will convert the file "template.clj" to:
<div id="test">
Clojure code starts here. <br />
1 + 1 = 1
</div>
